   - Features: Supports multiple programming languages

## Testing Frameworks

1. **Truffle**
   - Development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline
   - Features: Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment, and testing
   - Installation: `npm install -g truffle`

2. **Hardhat**
   - Development environment for Ethereum software

2. **Ethlint (formerly Solium)**
   - Linting tool for Solidity
   - Features: Style guide enforcement and security checks
   - Installation: `npm install -g ethlint`

## Gas Optimization Tools

1. **eth-gas-reporter**
   - Gas usage reporter for Truffle tests
   - Features: Tracks gas usage across different functions
   - Installation: `npm install --save-dev eth-gas-reporter`

2. **Gas Profiler**
   - Tool for analyzing gas usage in smart contracts
   - Features: Detailed gas consumption analysis

## Additional Resources

1. **OpenZeppelin Defender**
   - Security operations platform
   - Features: Monitoring, incident response, and automation

2. **Tenderly**
   - Smart contract monitoring and debugging platform
   - Features: Transaction simulation and debugging

## Recommended Workflow

1. Start with static analysis tools (Slither, Mythril)
2. Perform dynamic analysis (Echidna, Harvey)
3. Use formal verification for critical components
4. Implement comprehensive testing
5. Use gas optimization tools
6. Monitor deployed contracts

## Important Notes

- Always use multiple tools as no single tool can catch all vulnerabilities
- Keep tools updated to the latest versions
- Consider both automated and manual review processes
- Document all findings and remediation steps
- Stay updated with the latest security best practices and common vulnerabilities
